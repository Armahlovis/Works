<h1>Deep Learning  </h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>Deep Learning is a learning approach that enable computers to solve human level problems using hierracy of concepts </p></li>
<li><p>Hierracy of concept allow computers to learn complicated concept by building them out of simpler one  </p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge used by computers can be hard-coded in form of knowledge base or acquired by ML algorithms </p></li>
<li><p>Machine learning algorithm is affected by the representation of the input data. In represenation learning ML learns the represenation itself. Eg. Autoencoders </p></li>
<li><p>Depth of a model is measured by computational graph or depth of proability modeling graph </p></li>

</ol>


<h3>Historical Trends</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
    <li><p>Deep Learning, in the past, has been referred to by names such as cybernetics, connectionism and Aritificial Neural Network</p></li>
    <li><p>Increased amount of training data has made deep learning more useful  </p></li>
    <li><p>Models have increased in size and complexity due to improved infrastructure </p></li>
    <li><p>Deep learning has solved increasingly complicated applications with increasing accuracy. </p></li>
